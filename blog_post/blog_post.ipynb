    "# Logging for ML Model Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous blog posts we [introduced the decorator pattern](https://www.tekhnoal.com/ml-model-decorators.html) for ML model deployments and then showed how to use the pattern to build extensions for a ML model deployment. For example, in [this blog post](https://www.tekhnoal.com/data-enrichment-for-ml-models.html) we did data enrichment using a PostgreSQL database. The extensions were added without having to modify the machine learning model code at all, we were able to do it by using the decorator pattern. In this blog post we’ll add logging to a model deployment without having to modify the model code, using a decorator. In this blog post, we'll show how to use the decorator pattern to add logging functionality to an ML model.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As software systems become more and more complex, the people that build and operate these systems are finding that they are very hard to debug and inspect. To be able to solve this issue, a software system needs to be observable. An observable system is a system that allows an outside observer to infer the internal state of the system based purely on the data that it generates. The quality of \"observability\" helps the operators of a system to understand the inner workings of the system and to solve issues that may come up, even when the issues may be unprecedented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observability is a non-functional requirement (NFR) of a system. An NFR is a requirement that is placed on the operation of a system that has nothing to do with the specific functions of the system. Rather, it is a cross-cutting concern that needs to be addressed within the whole system design. Logging is a way that we can implement observability of a software system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of software systems, a \"log\" is a record of events that happen as software runs. A log is made up of individual records called log records that each represent a single event in the software system. Logs are useful for debugging the system, keeping a permanent record of it's activities, and many other purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A log record can be made of any data, but is usually encoded as text which makes a log record easy to create and read by humans. A log record can contain many pieces of information, but the most common are the date and time when the log record was created, a unique identifier for the log record, and some description of the event that caused the log record to be created. Logs are also usually tagged with the level of the severity of the event, for example an exception thrown during the execution of a program can be a handled or it can stop the execution, in either case a log can be generated with the correct level of the log. In general, log records are designed for debugging, alerting, and auditing the activities of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other software component, machine learning models need to create a log of events that may be useful later on. For example, we may want to know how many predictions the model made, how many errors occurred, and any other interesting events that we may want to keep track of. In this blog post we'll create a decorator that creates a log for a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is not meant to be a full guide for doing logging in Python, but we'll include some background information to make it easier to understand. Logging in Python can get complicated and there are other places that cover it more thoroughly. [Here](https://realpython.com/python-logging/) is a good place to learn more about Python logging.\n",

    "The logging decorator is executing right after the prediction request is received from the client and a prediction is made by the model, it will send logs to be handled by other services. The other services are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log Forwarder: a service that runs on each cluster node that forwards logs from the local hard drive to the log aggregator service.\n",
    "- Log Aggregator: a network service that receives logs from many sources, processes them, and formats them for the log storage service.\n",
    "- Log Storage: a network service that can store logs and also query them.\n",
    "- Log User Interface: a network service with a web interface that provides access to the logs stored in the log storage service.\n",

    "## Logging Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain things that we can do when we create a log for our application that makes it more useful, especially in productions settings. For example, attaching a \"level\" to each log record makes it easy to filter the log according to the severity of the events. For example, a log record is of level \"INFO\" when it communicates a simple action that the system has taken. A \"WARNING\" log event is an event that may indicate a problem in the system, but the system can continue to run. A good description of the common log levels is [here](https://sematext.com/blog/logging-levels/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good practice for logs is to include contextual information that can help to debug any problems that may arise in the execution of the code. For example, we can include the location in the codebase where the log record was generated. This information is very helpful during debugging and helps to quickly find the code that caused the event to happen. The information is often presented as the function name, code file name, and line number where the log message was generated. Another piece of useful contextual information is the hostname of the machine where the log was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs should be easy to interpret for both humans and machines, this means that log records  are often written in text strings. Humans can easily read text, but parsing a text string is complicated for machines. To allow both humans and machines to easily parse a log message, a good middle ground is to use JSON formatting. JSON-formatted logs are easy to parse, but also allow a human to quickly read and understand a log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique identifiers are useful to include in logs because they allow us to correlate many different log records together into a cohesive picture. For example, a correlation id is a unique ID that is generated to identify a specific transaction or query in a system. Adding unique identifiers to each log record can make it possible to debug complex problems that happen across system boundaries. A good description of correlation ids is [here](https://hilton.org.uk/blog/microservices-correlation-id)."

    "In this blog post we showed how to do logging with the Python logging package, and how to create a decorator that can help us to do logging around an MLModel. We also set up and used a logging system within a Kubernetes cluster and used it to aggregate logs and view them. Logging is usually the first thing that is implemented when we need to monitor how a system performs, and machine learning models are no exception to this. The logging decorator allowed us to do complex logging without having to modify the implementation of the model at all, thus simplifying a common aspect of software observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of using the decorator pattern is that we are able to build up complex behaviors around an object by combining decorator instances in the right order. We saw how to do this when we added a unique id to each prediction that the model made by adding the PredictionIDDecorator to the configuration. The prediction_id field was then added to the configuration of the LoggingDecorator as an extra field to add to the log records it produced. This approach allowed us to add a unique identifier to each prediction and also log the identifier with each log generated by the logging decorator, and we didnt have to write new code to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoggingDecorator class is very configurable, since we are able to configure it to log input and output fields from the model. This approach makes the implementation very flexible, since we do not need to modify the decorator's code to add fields to the log. The EnvironmentInfoFilter class that we implemented to grab information from the environment for logs is also built this way. We were able to get information about the Kubernetes deployment from the logs without having to modify the code at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoggingDecorator class is designed to work with MLModel classes, and this is the only hard requirement of the code. This makes the decorator very portable, because we are able to deploy it inside of any other model deployment service we may choose to build in the future. For example, we can just as easily decorate an MLModel instance runnning inside of an gRPC service, since the decorator would work exactly the same way. This is due to interface-driven approach that we took when designing the MLModel interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact is that we added logging to the ML model from the \"outside\" and we were not able to access information about the internals of the model. This is a limitation of the decorator approach to logging which only has access to the model inputs, model outputs, and exceptions raised by the model. This approach is best used to add logging functionality to an ML model implementation that we do not control, or in simple situations in which the limitations of the approach do not affect us. If any logging of internal model state is needed, we'll need to generate logs from within the MLModel class. "
